Project Description:

This frontend project simulates a Reddit-like platform where users can view articles, post comments and interact with content. It allows users to filter articles by topic, view specific articles for more details and vote or comment on articles.

To enhance the user experience, the website includes comprehensive error handling. For example, if a user attempts to access a non-existent article, they will be informed clearly. Additionally, the platform prevents common mistakes, such as voting multiple times on the same article or posting duplicate articles, ensuring smooth and intuitive interactions.
